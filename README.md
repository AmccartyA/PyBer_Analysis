# PyBer_Analysis

##Overview of the analysis
Using ride-sharing data, I put together a Dataframe (spreadsheet) based on the different city types in the data. Using the dataframe, I then gathered the totatl weekly fares for each city type to better understand what current cost changes are occuring throughout the year and put them into a multi-line chart. 

##Results

###Quick Glance information

Rural cities have the least amount of drivers, rides and total fares.
Urban cities have the most amount of drivers, rides and total fares.

Although Rural cities see the least amount of drivers, they have the highest average fare per ride and fare per driver.

##Conclusion
*Based off our data
    We can tell our CEO that he should consider hiring more drivers for the Suburban and Rural city areas. They had a better return on money in those areas for the          drivers. They also have a larger amount of riders who split a larger cost to travel greater distances.
    Another recomendation would be to lower the amount of drivers needed at the end of February. Based off of our Line-Chart, we can see that all 3 city-types saw a         reduction in service needs leading up to the start of March.
    Lastly, Decrease drivers in the Urban area as that fare per driver was lower then the fare amount paid.
